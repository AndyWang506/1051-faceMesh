# Difficulties:
Throughout the project, we found it difficult to bulid up the structure of a project, including the understanding of pip, .gitignore, virtual environment and so on.
Since this project requires the knowledge of class and object, understanding very basic concepts of object-oriented programming becomes crutial. (Everything is an object. Every object has a type. LOL)
We enjoy every learning process during the project, especially when we run the output and get exactly what we want.

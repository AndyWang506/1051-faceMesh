# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

TODO
Face recognition with webcam

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

TODO
A program that will detect our facial movemeent through the webcam. We will try to add facial landmarks in the program.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

TODO
This project will display a real-time face recognition. It will analyze the visual input to determine whether a personâ€™s facial features are present. We will set up this project by importing packages such as OpenCV to achieve our goal. We hope to display our face with landmarks on us. If not applicable, we will use square frames instead of landmarks.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable
Wen Shin Nicole, Su, tup38480.temple.edu, Elmira Talebianaraki
Mei Shuan Greta, Wang, tup38481.temple.edu, Elmira Talebianaraki

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

TODO
Let the project recognize the facial movements which are presented in images or videos by adding square frames.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO
Let the project recognize the real-time facial movements which are presented in webcams by adding square frames.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO
Let the project recognize the real-time facial movements which are presented in webcams by adding landmarks.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

TODO
# What new skills will you need to acquire?
Learning how to use Pycharm to create the project.
Learning to use the Python libraries.
Square frame & 468 Face Landmarks
Learning how to import images and videos into Python.
Learning how to connect the webcam to our software.
Learning the proper way to construct a project such as Dunder methods
# What topics will you need to research?
Square frame & 468 Face Landmarks
